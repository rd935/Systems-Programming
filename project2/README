Design
- first I had to set up a function that would process a given directory, which uses
  the built-in functions opendir and readdir to go through the text file(s) in the directory

- then came to build a function that would process a text file and go through each word to compare
  it to the dictionary given. This one uses the built-in functions fopen, fgets to get each word within
  the lines of the text file

- then the third function was to check if the word chosen from the text file was actually in the dictionary,
  which is quite simple in which strcmp was use to look into every word in the dictionary and compare if its the same.
  If the word is not found in the dictionary, then this function returns a 0, which then goes to the text file function
  and states that the word in the line and column is incorrect. To account for hyphens, I also made a sub-word check function, 
  so whenever a hyphen is found within a word, it will split that word and check each part seperately for misspellings 
  and then determine if the word is correct or not.
  
- the last function was to load the dictionary that is given in the command line, which is quite similar to the text file function,
  which uses fopen and fgets to go through the words in the dictionary and allocate memory for them. However, I used heap allocation 
  to make the process go much faster since the dictionary is likely to have hundreds of thousands of words.


Test Scenarios/Cases
- at first I tested it with one text file and changed the layout to have different columns and rows to make sure the 
  locations were outputting correctly
- next I tested the code with multiple different text files of different lengths, such as some that were a few lines and others
  that were full on paragraphs of texts
- the last test was creating a directory in the different location separate from the code folder, and seeing if the directory
  function was working the way it was supposed to. This directory also had multiple text files within it to make sure it was
  still outputting the correct errors throughout each text file.
